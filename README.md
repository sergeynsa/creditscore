---------------

There are many small business companies in a need of a credit line. There are multiple ways to get the businesses' credit score calculated: basing on the estimation by a bank or another credit line-related company. But does this really help us understand if people like this business or not? Does it give us an idea of the real rating of the business, of its competitors and on how successful this business is among them? What is the level of service provided by the competitors? In order to improve that I have decided to get some information from Google Place API. I hope this information could add a few more parameters to the traditional scoring process.



Try to imagine that you have the new client who needs a credit line...
